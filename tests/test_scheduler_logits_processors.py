"""Regression tests for the logits_processors call shape contract (#934).

mlx-lm's ``GenerationBatch._step`` does
``for p in self.logits_processors[e]`` whenever
``any(self.logits_processors)`` is True. If any per-row slot is ``None``
(instead of an empty list), this raises
``TypeError: 'NoneType' object is not iterable``.

This crash escapes omlx's recovery path if ``CACHE_CORRUPTION_PATTERNS``
doesn't match it, and presents to users as a request hang. See
``vllm-mlx-patched`` commit ``8d4052b`` for the same root cause in a
sibling project.

The caller-side wrap is necessary but **not sufficient**: on a heterogeneous
continuous-batch merge, mlx-lm's ``GenerationBatch.extend()`` re-introduces
None slots via ``if not any(self.logits_processors): self.logits_processors =
[None] * len(self.uids)``. Because ``any([[], []])`` is False, the empty-list
slots written at insert time collapse back to None whenever a batch with no
*active* processor merges with a grammar-constrained one (a plain chat request
joining a batch that is already serving a structured ``json_schema`` request).
The crash then fires from the merge path, not the insert path, and only
reproduces under request concurrency.

Three levels of defense:

1. **Chokepoint**: ``_patched_generation_batch_step`` normalises the whole
   list AND every per-row slot to ``[]`` before each step, covering both the
   insert and the ``extend()`` merge origins. This is the load-bearing guard.
2. **Caller-side**: ``omlx/scheduler.py`` always wraps ``logits_processors``
   as a list (possibly empty), never None, at the insert call site.
3. **Pattern matcher**: ``CACHE_CORRUPTION_PATTERNS`` includes
   ``"'NoneType' object is not iterable"`` so the scheduler recovers
   gracefully if a None slot ever sneaks through.

These tests pin all three invariants.
