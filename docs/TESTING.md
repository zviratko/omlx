# Cache-preserving engine teardown tests

Run `python -m pytest -q tests/test_engine_teardown.py tests/test_engine_core.py tests/test_scheduler.py tests/test_paged_ssd_cache.py tests/test_hot_cache.py tests/test_engine_pool.py tests/test_batched_engine.py tests/test_vlm_engine.py` to check the 60-second teardown budget and one progress-gated extension to 120 seconds. Clock tests cover the deadlines; short-budget subprocesses exercise fatal exits. Real writer-thread cases verify primary/draft flushes and in-flight prefix stores survive a saturated queue and can be reused after reload. Async cases cover event-loop responsiveness, cancellation, and leases during another model's unload.

# Claude launcher tests

Run `python -m pytest -q tests/test_cli.py tests/test_integrations.py` to check model selection, saved tier precedence, and the final Claude Code environment. Mixed-context cases verify that the selected initial model is passed through `ANTHROPIC_MODEL` and that the process-wide context and auto-compact limits use the smallest known context window across the initial model and configured tiers. Larger models consequently compact at that shared limit; models without reported limits cannot contribute a limit.

# ModernBERT embedding tests

Run `python -m pytest -q tests/test_modernbert_attention.py tests/test_embedding.py tests/test_mlx_embeddings_compat.py` to check finite padded attention, single-input equivalence, local-window masking, and embedding integration. The attention regression covers fp16, bf16, and fp32 at lengths around the affected SDPA tile boundaries.

# QSA reservation tests

Run `python -m pytest -q tests/test_qwen4_qsa_reservation_integration.py tests/test_qwen4_qsa_reserved_capacity.py` to check QSA capacity reservations.

The integration tests cover restored-prefix lengths with boundary snapshots enabled and disabled, the first allocation after cache restoration, and prefill/decode output equivalence using a small Qwen4 model.

Related regression suites are `test_qwen4_qsa_incremental_cache.py`, `test_qwen4_qsa_decode_gather.py`, and `test_prefill_oom_graceful.py`.

# Prefill memory accounting tests

Run `python -m pytest -q tests/test_prefill_transient_tracker.py tests/test_prefill_oom_graceful.py` to check retained versus reclaimed overhead, configured chunk sizes, and abort-cap enforcement. The loop tests run a small initialized MLX model with controlled footprint readings through external and chunked prefill; they do not load a checkpoint.

# Prefix cache completion tests

Run `python -m pytest -q tests/test_scheduler.py tests/test_scheduler_boundary_completion.py tests/test_prefix_cache_gdn_split.py` to check cache-freshness admission and completed boundary recovery. The completion tests use a small initialized Qwen3.5 hybrid model and the real BatchGenerator, then compare restored-prefix logits with a fresh forward pass. They cover embedded snapshots, GDN sidecars, off-boundary completion, and unknown or inconsistent cache positions.

# Cluster join recovery tests

Run `python -m pytest -q tests/test_cluster_pairing_session.py tests/test_cluster_pairing.py tests/test_cluster_ui_integration.py tests/ui/test_cluster_v2_wizard.py` to check joining, cancellation, and approval. Session tests recreate a manager with the same base path to verify that the original code and cancellation proof survive a restart. They also cover offline cancellation, switching peers while cleanup is pending, rejected requests versus lost responses, and storage failures. Wizard tests check that delayed responses cannot restore a cancelled join and that pending cleanup leaves new pairing controls available.

For a two-Mac smoke test, start isolated servers with separate base paths. Request a join, restart only the joining server, then cancel and retry; the coordinator must remove the original pending request. Repeat with the coordinator offline: cancellation must return `state: idle` with `cleanup_pending: true`, and joining a different reachable Mac must work. Restore the coordinator and poll the join endpoint to verify cleanup. Keep existing approval/cancel race and token-ownership tests in the run; never relax the coordinator's token check to make a stale request disappear.

# DeepSeek V4.1 offline tests

CED scheduler prefill, short suffix positions, full-logit scoring, and DSpark
continuity: `python -m pytest tests/test_deepseek_v41_ced.py tests/test_deepseek_v41_ssd.py -q`.
Replay is approximate; cache restoration is compared with the same chunk boundaries.

Run `python -m pytest -q tests/test_deepseek_v41.py` for the text/vision port. Synthetic weights and small recorded official outputs cover prefill/decode, DSpark, Engram and vision numerics without a checkpoint download or vendored reference implementation. See `tests/fixtures/deepseek_v41_expected.md` for provenance and reference corrections. PyTorch is optional for the independent FP8/FP4 arithmetic checks. Other cases cover BatchGenerator admission, cache restoration, DSML and VLM engine execution.

FP8 activation boundary and layout checks: `python -m pytest tests/test_deepseek_v41_activation.py -q`. These compare fused FP8 and weighted SwiGLU kernels against reference arithmetic across rounding ties, scale transitions, clipping, intermediate casts and floating-point dtypes.

MoE activation reuse and per-expert reference checks: `python -m pytest tests/test_deepseek_v41_moe.py -q`. These cover sorted prefill, decode, independent routed/shared activation policies, and repeated outputs with small quantized weights.

DeepSeek V4.1 Metal arithmetic and sparse-addressing checks: `python -m pytest tests/test_deepseek_v41_kernels.py -q` (no checkpoint required).

Packed attention rounding: `python -m pytest tests/test_deepseek_v41_attention_rounding.py -q`. An independent MLX oracle checks 64-key online maxima, FP32 denominators, BF16 PV probabilities, masking, sink placement, and growing or strided KV across the threadgroup capacity boundary. This does not execute the official CUDA kernels.

Engram storage and prefetch lifecycle: `python -m pytest tests/test_deepseek_v41_offload.py -q`. Modal state, forced-toggle behavior, and save payload: `node --test tests/deepseek_v41_offload_ui.test.cjs`. Both use synthetic fixtures and require no checkpoint download.


### MoE expert residency

`tests/test_deepseek_v41_moe_offload.py` exercises original and converted
V4.1 expert reads, MXFP4/MXFP8 and mixed-bit affine arithmetic, repeated
evictions, sorted routes, load/inference thread separation, Engram coexistence,
draft-weight exclusion, and memory estimates. The load probe rejects whole
expert reads from shared shards and any expert slab read through the Engram
mapping. Further cases check that consumed read buffers are released within the
in-flight byte window and pin the serial LRU order under concurrent reads,
expert-boundary chunking of sorted routes, and the fit-to-budget residency
helper against the admission arithmetic. Run alongside `test_deepseek_v41_offload.py`,
`test_moe_expert_offload.py`, and the engine-pool/model-settings suites.
`node tests/moe_expert_offload_ui.test.cjs` checks the actual dashboard
save/reopen payload and speculative-decoding toggle exclusion.

`tests/test_moe_expert_offload.py` also exercises Qwen4-Exp MoE routing with
512 experts, top-k 10, 64 resident slots, shared experts, and repeated
evictions. `tests/test_moe_offload_compat.py` covers the model-type allowlist,
checkpoint completeness, dense-model exclusion, API/runtime rejection, and
PLE/Engram metadata after expert savings.

# macOS port persistence tests

Run the `AppConfigTests`, `ServerProcessIntegrationTests`, `ServerScreenVMStorageDiffTests`, `AppServicesPathTests`, and `MenubarControllerPortTests` targets with `xcodebuild test`. For process tests, set `TEST_RUNNER_OMLX_INTEGRATION=1`, `TEST_RUNNER_OMLX_PYTHON_OVERRIDE` to a Python interpreter with oMLX dependencies, `TEST_RUNNER_PYTHONPATH` to the repository root, and `TEST_RUNNER_OMLX_BASE_PATH` to a fresh temporary directory so the test host does not start the user's configured server. Leave `TEST_RUNNER_OMLX_DEV_SERVER_SCRIPT` unset to exercise the real Python API and CLI with empty model directories. Setting it to `apps/omlx-mac/Scripts/dev_server.py` instead runs the lightweight process fixture.

The port cases cover offline Apply, recovery from an occupied port, web API saves followed by manual and automatic restarts, native Apply while running, client endpoint synchronization, and persistence across subsequent starts. Each child uses a temporary settings directory and an OS-selected port, and teardown stops the children. Endpoint-only persistence also checks that unrelated settings and corrupt files are preserved.

# Accuracy benchmark worker tests

Run `python -m pytest -q tests/test_eval_worker_pool.py tests/test_eval.py tests/test_accuracy_benchmark.py tests/test_admin_external_accuracy_diagnostics.py tests/test_accuracy_upload.py`. Worker tests cover slot refilling, thinking-mode retries, sequential code scoring without blocking generation, and repeated cancellation during scoring. Real HumanEval, MBPP, and LiveCodeBench subprocess cases verify normal completion, cancellation draining, and temporary-file cleanup with a controlled engine; no model checkpoint is required.

# Profile API exposure tests

Run `python -m pytest -q tests/test_admin_new_profile_expose_as_model.py tests/test_admin_profiles_api.py tests/test_model_settings_profiles.py`. The new-profile tests check toggle bindings, the OFF reset, and request serialization. Existing API tests cover the edit form, persistence, exposed model IDs, and name collisions.

### Lightning MTP with XTC sampling

Run `python -m pytest tests/test_mtp_xtc_sampling.py -q` for request sampler changes, late-joining mixed batches, row removal, and greedy sampling. These tests use a small MLX model and observe the MTP eligibility boundary; they do not execute a trained MTP head.

# VLM cache boundary tests

Run `python -m pytest -q tests/test_vlm_cache_boundaries.py tests/test_vlm_engine.py tests/test_prefix_cache.py tests/test_paged_cache.py` to check image-aware prefix keys. Boundary cases cover reasoning-dependent template prefixes, final grid token positions, adjacent images, multiple images per turn, block edges, invalid metadata, and isolation when earlier or later images change. These tests use synthetic processor inputs and KV arrays; checkpoint preprocessing and inference comparisons require local models.


### Profile consistency

Run `python -m pytest tests/test_model_settings_profiles.py tests/test_admin_profiles_api.py tests/test_admin_model_settings_template.py -q`. The editor behavior test executes the dashboard JavaScript with Node.js and is skipped if Node.js is unavailable. The cases cover latest-template application, same-name model preservation, renamed and deleted template references, persistence rollback, create-and-apply behavior, and preserving edits during focus refresh. The macOS `ProfileScopeTests` cover source references, stale copies, orphan visibility, and display names. For a manual cross-client check, edit a global profile in the web UI, apply it from the app, and verify the model's effective settings; repeat with an independent same-name model profile and with an unsaved editor open.

Global and model profiles may share display names while retaining separate IDs. Applying a global template reads its latest settings; deleting it preserves model copies as independent profiles. Both editors save and apply new profiles, and focus refresh preserves unsaved edits.

Startup reference repair is covered in `tests/test_model_settings_profiles.py`: missing references are cleared without replacing saved values, originals are backed up under `<base_path>/profile-reference-backup-*`, and subsequent loads do not write again. Retries with unchanged originals reuse the same content-hash backup directory and fill missing files. Mismatched backups prevent repair. Invalid storage, unsupported versions, backup failures, and failed writes must not persist inferred repairs. A rollback failure aborts startup and logs the backup path.
