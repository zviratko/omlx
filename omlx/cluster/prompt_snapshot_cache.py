"""SSD-backed prompt-cache snapshots for the distributed rank server.

A distributed rank runs the pinned ``mlx_lm.server`` with a rank-local
in-memory prompt cache. That cache is bounded and dies with the process, and it
cannot help a model whose per-layer state is not sliceable: a ``RotatingKVCache``
overwrites its window and a gated-delta-net keeps a single recurrent state, so
the state at an interior prefix boundary is gone the moment prefill moves past
it. This store persists chains of boundary files to local SSD, using MLX-LM's
own ``save_prompt_cache`` / ``load_prompt_cache`` so every cache type
serialises through its declared ``state`` / ``meta_state``.

A boundary file holds what that boundary added, mirroring the local paged SSD
cache's policy: plain ``KVCache`` members store only their newest step-sized
slab (positionally immutable, so a chain holds one copy of the KV rather than
one cumulative copy per boundary), while non-sliceable members (rotating
windows, recurrent slots, pooling state) store their full state at that
boundary, which is the only representation they have and is what makes every
boundary an independent restore point for them.

Each rank keeps its own directory holding its own layer-slice snapshots. The
keys are a hash of ``(model, prefix tokens)`` and are therefore identical across
ranks that processed the same broadcast request, while the bytes under a key are
this rank's shard alone; prompts sharing a prefix share the early chain files.
Eviction is a deterministic bounded LRU keyed on the sequence of operations
rather than a wall clock, so ranks that see the same requests keep identical key
sets without any coordination. Coordinating the *hit* across ranks (so a disk
write that failed on one rank cannot desync the pipeline) is the caller's job
and lives in the telemetry integration, which has the collective; this module
stays pure and unit-testable.

When persistence is enabled, a compact atomic manifest records the digest,
boundary and byte size of every chain segment. The digest already commits to
the model identity and exact prefix tokens, so the manifest does not duplicate
the token arrays (which would grow quadratically at long context). Directories
are scoped by plan hash and rank by the worker, preventing a changed tensor
split from ever reading another shard layout. A missing or invalid manifest
fails closed by clearing otherwise-unindexable files.
