"""MoE expert offloading: stream non-resident experts from the checkpoint.

For Mixture-of-Experts models whose expert tables do not fit in memory, keep
only ``resident_fraction`` of each layer's experts in a contiguous slot tensor
and fetch the rest on demand from the model's own safetensors shards
(positional slab reads — no converted copy of the checkpoint, no write
path). Routing is computed exactly as shipped; a cache miss changes *when*
an expert's weights are read, never *which* expert runs. Accuracy is
therefore preserved by construction, at a latency cost (measured on a 26B/128-expert model: accuracy
flat down to 12% residency, throughput falling roughly as memory^0.5).

Applied once post-load, before lazy weights materialize: each stock
``SwitchGLU`` whose projections are quantized and fully covered by the
checkpoint is replaced with an ``OffloadSwitchGLU``. The original module —
and with it the lazy references to the full expert tensors — is dropped, so
the non-resident experts are never materialized at all. Instances that are
unsupported (non-quantized, fused ``gate_up_proj``, per-expert ``bias``, or
tensor names the checkpoint does not contain) are left untouched.

Numerical contract, measured against the pinned mlx-lm: decode and unsorted
prefill are bit-identical to the stock path at any residency; the sorted
prefill kernel (``indices.size >= 64``) is presentation-invariant at real
model dimensions, so full-residency prefill is bit-identical too. Partial
residency can legitimately chunk a prefill below the sort threshold, where
the sorted and unsorted gather_qmm kernels differ by ~4e-3 absolute on
~5-magnitude outputs — rounding, not routing (see the test suite's
assertion policy).
