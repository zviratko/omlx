"""Patch mlx-vlm's Qwen3.5 ``Model.sanitize`` to preserve MTP weights.

The stock implementation in
``mlx_vlm/models/qwen3_5/qwen3_5.py`` strips every ``mtp.*`` key on the
first line and only shifts a fixed list of backbone norm suffixes by
+1. With Qwen3.5/3.6 native MTP heads (PR 990 layout), the MTP block
also has its own RMSNorm weights that need the +1 shift — both the
in-block ``input_layernorm`` / ``post_attention_layernorm`` /
``q_norm`` / ``k_norm`` (caught by the existing suffix patterns once
``mtp.*`` is no longer stripped) and three MTP-specific norms
(``mtp.norm.weight``, ``mtp.pre_fc_norm_hidden.weight``,
``mtp.pre_fc_norm_embedding.weight``) that have no analogue in the
backbone and are missed entirely.

After this patch the sanitize body keeps mtp tensors intact, applies
the +1 shift to MTP norms (raw HF only), and remains idempotent for
already-converted checkpoints by guarding the shift on the unsanitized
conv1d marker (matches mlx_lm_mtp/qwen35_model.py).
