"""MTP-head prompt priming: fold the prompt into the head cache during prefill.

Without priming the MTP head starts generation with an empty KV cache — its
first drafts see none of the prompt and acceptance starts context-starved,
recovering only as committed generation tokens accumulate (MTPLX measured
committed-history priming at 0.90 acceptance vs 0.26 unprimed on depth-1
real-code prompts). This module rides the existing prefill forwards: every
backbone chunk forward already computes the trunk-normed hidden for all chunk
positions, so the (hidden[t], token[t+1]) pairs the head history needs are
available for free. Each chunk is folded into a head cache immediately and
the chunk hidden is discarded — only a single (1, 1, H) pending row carries
across chunks.

Transport: scheduler requests own their contexts until insertion assigns a
BatchGenerator UID. Decode capture uses the exact UID order of the active
GenerationBatch, including ordinary decode used for cost calibration. The
host slot is only a cursor while a request or row runs. Direct singleton
callers retain the original slot interface. Every capture also verifies
offset contiguity; request identity and offset are both required.

Capture sites (each calls :func:`maybe_capture` after the backbone forward):

- mlx-lm qwen3_5 text path: the patched ``TextModel.__call__``
  (``qwen35_model``), which computes the trunk-normed hidden inline.
- mlx-vlm qwen3_5 path: a wrap on the inner ``Qwen3_5Model.__call__``
  (``qwen35_vlm_runtime``), whose return value *is* the trunk-normed
  hidden; the MoE inner model inherits it. The outer ``LanguageModel`` is
  reached via a weakref stamped at init.
- DeepSeek-V4 (``deepseek_v4_model``): the patched ``Model.__call__``
  requests ``return_raw_hidden`` and passes the raw 4D Hyper-stream hidden
  (the head input variant; no trunk norm).
- GLM-5.2 (``glm_moe_dsa_model``): the patched ``Model.__call__`` passes
  the post-final-norm hidden it already computes.

All sites skip ``return_hidden=True`` forwards (MTP verify cycles and the
activation forward in ``_post_init_mtp``); the final (hidden[prompt[-1]],
main_tok) pair is folded by :func:`take_primed` at activation instead.
