    calling MLX directly. Maps to HTTP 400 via the server's
    ``prefill_memory_exceeded_handler``.

    ``cached_tokens`` means prompt KV *already resident in current memory*
    (e.g. the scheduler's paged prefix cache) — not merely "tokens that hit
    a cache". A cache whose hits re-allocate KV (DFlash prefix snapshots)
    must pass 0.

    The component ceilings are optional: callers that receive the
    enforcer's breakdown (the DFlash prefill guard) pass them so the
    rejection names the binding constraint the same way the scheduler's
    does. Callers that do not fall back to generic advice.
