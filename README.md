> *Every LLM server I tried made me choose between convenience and control. I wanted to pin everyday models in memory, auto-swap heavier ones on demand, set context limits - and manage it all from a menu bar.*
>
> *oMLX persists KV cache across a hot in-memory tier and cold SSD tier - even when context changes mid-conversation, all past context stays cached and reusable across requests, making local LLMs practical for real coding work with tools like Claude Code. That's why I built it.*

## Install

### macOS App

Download the `.dmg` from [Releases](https://github.com/jundot/omlx/releases), drag to Applications, done. The app includes in-app auto-update, so future upgrades are just one click. The macOS app also installs a lightweight `~/.omlx/bin/omlx` CLI shim so terminal commands and Apple Shortcuts can control the app-managed server.

### Homebrew

```bash
brew tap jundot/omlx https://github.com/jundot/omlx
brew install jundot/omlx/omlx

# Upgrade to the latest version
brew update && brew upgrade omlx

# Run as a background service (auto-restarts on crash)
omlx start

# Optional: MCP (Model Context Protocol) support
/opt/homebrew/opt/omlx/libexec/bin/pip install mcp
```

Optional GLM-5.2 / MiniMax M3 native custom kernels currently require a HEAD build:

```bash
brew install jundot/omlx/omlx --HEAD --with-custom-kernel
```

### From Source

```bash
git clone https://github.com/jundot/omlx.git
cd omlx
pip install -e .          # Core only
pip install -e ".[mcp]"   # With MCP (Model Context Protocol) support

# GLM-5.2 / MiniMax M3 / Qwen3.5 native custom kernels (strongly recommended
# if you serve those families -- see note below)
OMLX_WITH_CUSTOM_KERNEL=1 pip install -e .
```

Requires macOS 15.0+ (Sequoia), Python 3.11–3.13, and Apple Silicon (M1/M2/M3/M4/M5).

> **Note on native custom kernels:** a plain `pip install -e .` does NOT build
> them, and the affected model families then silently fall back to much slower
> generic paths -- for GLM-5.2 the fused DSA prefill is roughly 30x faster with
> the kernels (measured 845 vs ~29 tok/s on an M3 Ultra), and the fallback also
> uses more memory (#2137). Building them requires the Metal toolchain, which
> Command Line Tools alone do not provide (`xcrun: error: unable to find utility
> "metal"`): install full Xcode, or use the official DMG which ships the kernels
> precompiled. Homebrew can build them with `brew install jundot/omlx/omlx --HEAD
> --with-custom-kernel`, but that build also needs full Xcode. To verify your
> install:
>
> ```bash
> python -c "from omlx.custom_kernels import native_kernel_status; print(native_kernel_status())"
> ```

## Quickstart

### macOS App

Launch oMLX from your Applications folder. The Welcome screen guides you through three steps - model directory, server start, and first model download. That's it. To connect OpenClaw, OpenCode, Codex, Hermes Agent, or Copilot, see [Integrations](#integrations).

<p align="center">
  <img src="docs/images/Screenshot 2026-02-10 at 00.36.32.png" alt="oMLX Welcome Screen" width="360">
  <img src="docs/images/Screenshot 2026-02-10 at 00.34.30.png" alt="oMLX Menubar" width="240">
</p>

### CLI

```bash
# Managed background server (macOS app or Homebrew install)
omlx start
omlx stop
omlx restart

# Foreground server attached to this terminal
omlx serve --model-dir ~/models
```

The server discovers LLMs, VLMs, embedding models, and rerankers from subdirectories automatically. Any OpenAI-compatible client can connect to `http://localhost:8000/v1`. A built-in chat UI is also available at `http://localhost:8000/admin/chat`.

### Homebrew Service

If you installed via Homebrew, you can run oMLX as a managed background service:

```bash
omlx start                    # Start via brew services
omlx stop                     # Stop
omlx restart                  # Restart

brew services start omlx    # Start (auto-restarts on crash)
brew services stop omlx     # Stop
brew services restart omlx  # Restart
brew services info omlx     # Check status
```

The service runs `omlx serve` with zero-config defaults (`~/.omlx/models`, port 8000). `omlx start`, `omlx stop`, and `omlx restart` are the portable lifecycle commands; Homebrew installs delegate them to `brew services`. To customize, either set environment variables (`OMLX_MODEL_DIR`, `OMLX_PORT`, etc.) or run `omlx serve --model-dir /your/path` once to persist settings to `~/.omlx/settings.json`.

Logs are written to two locations:
- **Service log**: `$(brew --prefix)/var/log/omlx.log` (stdout/stderr)
- **Server log**: `~/.omlx/logs/server.log` (structured application log)

## Features

Supports text LLMs, vision-language models (VLM), OCR models, embeddings, and rerankers on Apple Silicon.

### Admin Dashboard

Web UI at `/admin` for real-time monitoring, model management, chat, benchmark, and per-model settings. Supports English, Korean, Japanese, Chinese, French, Russian, Spanish, and Brazilian Portuguese. All CDN dependencies are vendored for fully offline operation.

</p>

### Experimental Multi-Mac Inference

Source builds can split one downloaded language model across unequal-memory Macs
using MLX pipeline ranks over Ring or Thunderbolt RDMA/JACCL. The Cluster
dashboard handles read-only peer discovery, strict SSH/runtime verification,
byte-aware unequal shard planning, measured compute/link rebalancing,
headroom-aware execution tuning, activation, and a live shard/performance map
on both Macs. Interactive, balanced, and throughput profiles expose coalesced
batching, prompt-cache affinity, rotating-KV limits, Ring connection tuning,
and a capability-gated experimental token-only output path. See
[Distributed inference across Macs](docs/distributed-cluster.md) for setup,
security boundaries, current limitations, and the physical-hardware validation
checklist.

### Vision-Language Models

Run VLMs with the same continuous batching and tiered KV cache stack as text LLMs. Supports multi-image chat, base64/URL/file image inputs, and tool calling with vision context. MiMo V2.6 checkpoints with bundled sidecars also accept sampled-frame video and 24 kHz audio. oQ conversion of official MiMo V2.6 checkpoints preserves image and audio support. OCR models (DeepSeek-OCR, DOTS-OCR, GLM-OCR) are auto-detected with optimized prompts.

### Tiered KV Cache (Hot + Cold)

Block-based KV cache management inspired by vLLM, with prefix sharing and Copy-on-Write. The cache operates across two tiers:

- **Hot tier (RAM)**: Frequently accessed blocks stay in memory for fast access.
- **Cold tier (SSD)**: When the hot cache fills up, blocks are offloaded to SSD in safetensors format. On the next request with a matching prefix, they're restored from disk instead of recomputed from scratch - even after a server restart.

<p align="center">
  <img src="docs/images/omlx_hot_cold_cache.png" alt="oMLX Hot & Cold Cache" width="720">
</p>

### Continuous Batching

Handles concurrent requests through mlx-lm's BatchGenerator. Max concurrent requests is configurable via CLI or admin panel.

### Claude Code Optimization

Context scaling support for running smaller context models with Claude Code. Scales reported token counts so that auto-compact triggers at the right timing, and SSE keep-alive prevents read timeouts during long prefill.

### Multi-Model Serving

Load LLMs, VLMs, embedding models, and rerankers within the same server. Models are managed through a combination of automatic and manual controls:

- **LRU eviction**: Least-recently-used models are evicted automatically when memory runs low.
- **Manual load/unload**: Interactive status badges in the admin panel let you load or unload models on demand.
- **Model pinning**: Pin frequently used models to keep them always loaded.
- **Per-model TTL**: Set an idle timeout per model to auto-unload after a period of inactivity.
- **Process memory enforcement**: Total memory limit (default: system RAM - 8GB) prevents system-wide OOM.

### Per-Model Settings

Configure sampling parameters, chat template kwargs, TTL, model alias, model type override, and more per model directly from the admin panel. Changes apply immediately without server restart.

- **Model alias**: set a custom API-visible name. `/v1/models` returns the alias, and requests accept both the alias and directory name.
- **Model type override**: manually set a model as LLM or VLM regardless of auto-detection.
- **Profiles**: save named bundles of per-model settings and switch between them from the admin panel. A profile can optionally be exposed as its own model: `/v1/models` then also lists `<model>:<profile>` (e.g. `qwen3-8b:thinking`), which serves on the same engine as the base model with the profile's settings overlaid per request — no extra memory, no reload. When the base model has an alias, the exposed ID is advertised as `<alias>:<profile>`; the directory-name form keeps working, just like for the base model.

</p>

### Built-in Chat

Chat directly with any loaded model from the admin panel. Supports conversation history, model switching, dark mode, reasoning model output, and image upload for VLM/OCR models.

<p align="center">
  <img src="docs/images/ScreenShot_2026-03-14_104350_610.png" alt="oMLX Chat" width="720">
</p>


### Model Downloader

Search and download MLX models from HuggingFace directly in the admin dashboard. Browse model cards, check file sizes, and download with one click.

<p align="center">
  <img src="docs/images/downloader_omlx.png" alt="oMLX Model Downloader" width="720">
</p>

### Integrations

Set up OpenClaw, OpenCode, Codex, Hermes Agent, Copilot, and Pi directly from the admin dashboard with a single click. No manual config editing required.

<p align="center">
  <img src="docs/images/omlx_integrations.png" alt="oMLX Integrations" width="720">
</p>

### Performance Benchmark

One-click benchmarking from the admin panel. Measures prefill (PP) and text generation (TG) tokens per second, with partial prefix cache hit testing for realistic performance numbers.

<p align="center">
  <img src="docs/images/benchmark_omlx.png" alt="oMLX Benchmark Tool" width="720">
</p>

### macOS Menubar App

Native Swift / SwiftUI menubar app (not Electron). Start, stop, and monitor the server without opening a terminal. Includes [local usage history](docs/usage-analytics.md) with per-model totals and an hourly heatmap, persistent serving stats (survives restarts), auto-restart on crash, and built-in auto-update.

<p align="center">
  <img src="docs/images/Screenshot 2026-02-10 at 00.51.54.png" alt="oMLX Menubar Stats" width="400">
</p>

### API Compatibility

Drop-in replacement for OpenAI and Anthropic APIs. Supports streaming usage stats (`stream_options.include_usage`), Anthropic adaptive thinking, and vision inputs (base64, URL).

| Endpoint | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `POST /v1/chat/completions` | Chat completions (streaming) |
| `POST /v1/completions` | Text completions (streaming) |
| `POST /v1/messages` | Anthropic Messages API |
| `POST /v1/embeddings` | Text embeddings |
| `POST /v1/rerank` | Document reranking |
| `GET /v1/models` | List available models |

### Tool Calling & Structured Output

Supports all function calling formats available in mlx-lm, JSON schema validation, and MCP tool integration. Tool calling requires the model's chat template to support the `tools` parameter. The following model families are auto-detected:

| Model Family | Format |
|---|---|
| Llama, Qwen, DeepSeek, etc. | JSON `<tool_call>` |
| Qwen3.5 Series | XML `<function=...>` |
| Gemma | `<start_function_call>` |
| GLM (4.7, 5) | `<arg_key>/<arg_value>` XML |
| MiniMax | Namespaced `<minimax:tool_call>` |
| Mistral | `[TOOL_CALLS]` |
| IFM K2 Horizon | XML or JSON inside `<ifm\|tool_calls>`. Requires `omlx[grammar]` |
| Kimi K2 | `<\|tool_calls_section_begin\|>` |
| Longcat | `<longcat_tool_call>` |

Models not listed above may still work if their chat template accepts `tools` and their output uses a recognized `<tool_call>` XML format. For tool-enabled streaming, assistant text is emitted incrementally while known tool-call control markup is suppressed from visible content; structured tool calls are emitted after parsing the completed turn.

## Models

Point `--model-dir` at a directory containing MLX-format model subdirectories. Two-level organization folders (e.g., `mlx-community/model-name/`) are also supported.

```
~/models/
├── Step-3.5-Flash-8bit/
├── Qwen3-Coder-Next-8bit/
├── gpt-oss-120b-MXFP4-Q8/
├── Qwen3.5-122B-A10B-4bit/
└── bge-m3/
```

Models are auto-detected by type. You can also download models directly from the admin dashboard.

| Type | Models |
|------|--------|
| LLM | Any model supported by [mlx-lm](https://github.com/ml-explore/mlx-lm) |
| VLM | Qwen3.5 Series, GLM-4V, Pixtral, and other [mlx-vlm](https://github.com/Blaizzy/mlx-vlm) models |
| OCR | DeepSeek-OCR, DOTS-OCR, GLM-OCR |
| Embedding | BERT, BGE-M3, ModernBERT |
| Reranker | ModernBERT, XLM-RoBERTa |

## CLI Configuration

```bash
# Managed background server (macOS app or Homebrew install)
omlx start
omlx stop
omlx restart

# Start with default settings (memory guard tier = balanced, manage via admin UI)
omlx serve --model-dir ~/models

# Choose a memory guard tier at startup
omlx serve --model-dir ~/models --memory-guard safe

# Set a custom memory guard ceiling in GB
omlx serve --model-dir ~/models --memory-guard-gb 48

# Enable SSD cache for KV blocks
omlx serve --model-dir ~/models --paged-ssd-cache-dir ~/.omlx/cache

# Set in-memory hot cache size
omlx serve --model-dir ~/models --hot-cache-max-size 20%

# Adjust max concurrent requests (default: 8)
omlx serve --model-dir ~/models --max-concurrent-requests 16

# With MCP tools
omlx serve --model-dir ~/models --mcp-config mcp.json

# HuggingFace mirror endpoint (for restricted regions)
omlx serve --model-dir ~/models --hf-endpoint https://hf-mirror.com

# API key authentication
omlx serve --model-dir ~/models --api-key your-secret-key
# Localhost-only: skip verification via admin panel global settings

# Network access requires authentication
OMLX_API_KEY=your-secret-key omlx serve --model-dir ~/models --host 0.0.0.0
```

The default SSD cache limit, `auto`, uses 50% of the sum of free disk space and existing SSD cache files, including GDN sidecars. The budget is refreshed during use and does not shrink simply because the cache grows or the server restarts. Other disk usage can change the budget. Set `--paged-ssd-cache-max-size 20GB` for a fixed limit.


Most settings can also be configured from the web admin panel at `/admin`. Settings are persisted to `~/.omlx/settings.json`, and CLI flags take precedence.
Set the main API key before changing the server host to a LAN address or `0.0.0.0`, or save both settings together. oMLX refuses to start on any non-loopback address without a main API key. The existing `skip_api_key_verification` option remains restricted to loopback-only binds.

For keyless inference, stop oMLX, manually set `auth.allow_unauthenticated_inference` to `true` in `settings.json`, and restart. It defaults to `false` and has no UI toggle. This allows anyone who can reach the server to use inference (including stored Responses and audio), MCP tools, and web search. On network binds, keep a main API key configured and `skip_api_key_verification` set to `false`; management endpoints still require authentication.

## Development

### CLI Server

```bash
git clone https://github.com/jundot/omlx.git
cd omlx
pip install -e ".[dev]"
pytest -m "not slow"
```

### macOS App

The native SwiftUI app lives at `apps/omlx-mac/`. Requires Xcode 26.5+ and Python 3.11+. venvstacks is declared as a dev dependency so `pip install -e ".[dev]"` (or `uv sync --dev`) brings the pinned version in. The build script also falls back to `uvx venvstacks` or `pipx run venvstacks` if you prefer a host-global tool runner.

```bash
# Stage a runnable oMLX.app (xcodebuild + venvstacks Python layers + ad-hoc sign)
apps/omlx-mac/Scripts/build.sh release

# Result lands at apps/omlx-mac/build/Stage/oMLX.app
open apps/omlx-mac/build/Stage/oMLX.app

# Force a fresh venvstacks rebuild (otherwise it's cached by fingerprint)
apps/omlx-mac/Scripts/build.sh release --rebuild-donor

# Stage with optional GLM-5.2 / MiniMax M3 native custom kernels
apps/omlx-mac/Scripts/build.sh release --with-custom-kernel
```

First cold build takes 10–20 minutes (venvstacks Python layer assembly). Subsequent builds reuse the cached `packaging/_export/` and finish in about 4 minutes. See [packaging/README.md](packaging/README.md) for the layer configuration and [apps/omlx-mac/](apps/omlx-mac/) for the Swift sources.
